# Hawaii Weather Station Analysis

### Plan your next Hawaiian getaway based on weather data!

Using the station_analysis file above, you can perform some basic analysis using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas and Matplotlib. The analysis includes a look into the precipitation in the last 12 months of the dataset, weather station level views at the frequency of documented temperatures and temperature variability at the most active station in the last 12 months on the dataset.

Using the app.py file above, you can perform similar queries as mentioned previously with the results returned through a Flask API. You can use the last two available routes to look at data after a specific date or within a daterange by mdofiying the URL with a date of interest (date format: 'YYYY-MM-DD').
